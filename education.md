I began attending the University of Missouri in Fall 2018 after attending  
St.Charles Community College for a year. I am currently in my Junior  
year studying Environmental Science with an emphasis in  
Water Quality. I hope to further my education by attending  
graduate school studying Oceanography.

I am currently employed at the University's Limnology Lab,    
where I work as a Lab Technician  
testing samples from various lakes and streams across Missouri.
